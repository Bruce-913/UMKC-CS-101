Code:
    print(greetings)
          ^^^^^^^^^
    NameError: name 'greetings' is not defined

    Reasoning: greetings was used without being defined beforehand

Code:
    def greet()
               ^
    SyntaxError: expected ':'

    Reasoning: function was missing a : at the end

Code:
    def greet
             ^
    SyntaxError: expected '('

    Reasoning: No parenthesis where function was declared allowing for no parameters

Code:
    if x ===1:
           ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

    Reasoning: Written incorrectly, expected 1 less "=" sign.

Code:
    import yes
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yes'

Code:
    fruit.append("fruit)

    SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 19)
    Reasoning: parenthesis was not closed

Code:
    yup = int("yes")
    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'yes'

    Reasoning: "yes" is not an int

Code:
    print ('Hello, World!")
           ^
    SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 18)

    Reasoning: quote are not matching

Code:
    print ("Hello, World!"))
                           ^
    SyntaxError: unmatched ')'

    Reasoning: Expected another parenthesis before the second one so it could be opened and closed
